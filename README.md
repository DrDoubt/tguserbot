# tguserbot

Small userbot for telegram. This project aims to be a simple to use, modular
userbot for Telegram users. It is based of [PaperPlane Extended](https://github.com/AvinashReddy3108/PaperplaneExtended), yet completely
stripped down and worked on for months. It does not use SQL or any Database entirely. It contains some changes of my own, some commands have been added, a lot removed and some have changed the names to more user friendly names.

Out of the box, most PaperPlane (and PaperPlane Extended) modules *should* work, with a small change in the imports, and maybe the installation of some dependencies.
